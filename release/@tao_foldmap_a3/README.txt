Tao Folding Map
README
-------------------------------

Folding Map lets you open a tactical map while in game which is bigger and more useful than the GPS.

HOW TO
-------------------------------
* Press Shift-Map (default 'm') to pop up the map.

* While the map is open, press Shift-Ctrl-Zoom In/Out (default Numpad +/-) to zoom in and out.

* Press Shift-Ctrl-Nightvision (default 'n') to change to night mode.

* If you are on Veteran difficulty, you will only see your position if you have a GPS device.

* If you'd like to change the key bindings, see UserConfig\tao_foldmap_a3\tao_foldmap_a3.hpp

* If you'd prefer a paper map, see UserConfig\tao_foldmap_a3\tao_foldmap_a3.hpp
